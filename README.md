Neo4j is a NoSQL Graph Database designed for high peformance transactional graphs. It is orders of magnitude more performant than relational databases for highly connected datasets where the primary usecase is navigation and path selection between them. Although, social network is the first thing that springs to one's mind when thinking of Neo4j, there are several problems that are amenable to graph solutions. For example, transitive authorizations and permissions can be modelled using graphs.
